ODS Login Dialog
================

This is the development version of the ODS login dialog, currently based on Bootstrap,
jQuery, and ods.js.

The goal is to create a drop-in Javascript component which allows to easily add ODS user
management capabilities to any website.

Demo
-----

index.html provides a basic demo of how to integrate the dialogs into a page. Currently
that involves including a bunch of js and css files and loading a blob of html which
contains the dialogs.

Contribute
----------
Please contribute by improving the look and feel, stripping away dependencies, making
css class names less "clashy", and working on an improved way to integrate the dialogs
into a page.
