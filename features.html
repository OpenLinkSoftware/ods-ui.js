      <p>ODS brings full profile management. Store your personal details and share details according to ODS' powerful ACL rules with other ODS users or any person that can be identified via their WebID. An ODS profile can hold many personal details including online accounts, favorite things, likes and dislikes, areas of interest, product and service wishes, or the social network.</p>
      <p>User profiles are exported as FOAF profiles which can be combined with an X.509 certificate to create fully functional WebIDs for each user profile. As with all data in ODS the profile is accessible as linked data through Virtuoso's SPARQL end-point or by dereferencing the personal URI and requesting an appropriate format like Turtle, JSON-LD, or RDF+XML.</p>
      <p>ODS supports a variety of registration and login mechanisms including WebID, OpenID, or OAuth-powered services like Facebook or Twitter. Accounts can be created by providing simple password digest information or by connecting them to existing accounts or identifiers from other services.</p>

      <h1>File Management <small>WebDAV With a Vengance</small></h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>With the Briefcase ODS provides a WebDAV-compliant platform that offers advanced file-sharing capabilities.</p>
      <p>In addition to basic WebDAV file management and its complex ACL rule driven security and file-sharing functionality the Briefcase has a wide range of additional feature that make it one of the most powerful file storage systems available.</p>
      <p>The Briefcase benefits from Virtuoso's Sponger module to automatically extract file metadata from a wide array of file formats including MS Office, Open Office, Open Document Format, Content Syndication Formats (RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, Atom, OPML, OCS), (X)HTML, Web Services Contract Files (BPEL, WSDL), XBRL, XBEL, FOAF, iCalendar, hCalendar, vCARD or Google Base Items. This information is available either as pure WebDAV data or as RDF. The latter is, as with all resources in ODS, available by dereferencing the file URIs using content-negotiation or my querying Virtuoso's SPARQL end-point. This also includes the powerful full-text search capabilities of Virtuoso which can be combined with arbitrary complex structured queries.</p>
      <p>Briefcase also supports UNIX-style file-permissions as a simple alternative to the powerful ACL rule system.</p>
      <p>Briefcase allows to mount other known web storage solutions like Google Drive, Amazon S3, SkyDrive or Dropbox directly into your ODS Briefcase and apply the same powerful ACL rules to them as to any other resource. Through the same mechanism non-physical WebDAV resources like contacts or feed posts can be provided as files in the WebDAV system.</p>
      <p>Smart folders allow to browse files by their meta-data. For example the path <em>DAV/home/[username]/Items/Graphics/Type/JPEG</em> lists all the graphic images that are of type JPEG for a given user.</p>
      <p>The Briefcase supports version control for any resources using any client supporting the DeltaV core feature set. Historical versions of resources will appear in a separate virtual folder. DeltaV core WebDAV methods are supported for resources for which versioning has been enabled.</p>
      <p>Flexible and Open data access are key in the ODS Briefcase. It can be transparently integrated into any WebDAV-compliant environment like MAC OS X Finder, Windows Explorer, or Linux DAV mounts. In addition as with all resources in ODS the data is exported as RDF and accessible through the <a href="/odsdox/group__ods__module__briefcase.html">Briefcase HTTP API</a>.</p>

      <p>ODS provides a full calendar system for event and note management. Schedule new events, add attending people, configure reminders, create tasks with priority, due date, attendees, or manage comments.</p>
      <p>ODS can subscribe to external calendar resources via CalDAV or by importing ICS files from any WebDAV system or any URL. In the same way calendar events and tasks can be exported or published to any writable URL or any CalDAV resource. The ODS Calendar supports several formats for resource syndication like RSS, Atom, or <a href="http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/">RDF SIOC</a>.</p>
      <p>Events and tasks can be shared with other users through ODS' advanced ACL rule system allowing fine grained privacy settings on any resource.</p>
      <p>The ODS Calendar supports synchronization via SyncML through the ODS Briefcase's powerful virtual folder system.</p>
      <p>ODS Clients can either manage events by directly accessing the resources via CalDAV, by writing to an ics file which the Calendar instance is subscribed to, or by using the <a href="/odsdox/group__ods__module__calendar.html">ODS Calendar API</a>.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
      <p>ODS integrates a complete and highly scalable E-Mail solution which ranges from simple E-Mail storage and sending to complex smart folder filtering. The ODS mail solution can act as an email client and a server, supporting IMAP, IMAPS, and POP3. It allows to combine and filter the E-Mails from external accounts with the ones directly stored in ODS.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the RDF exposure of the resources and powerful SPARQL-based E-Mail filtering the possibilities of virtual sorting and filtering are endless. Smart folders allow to filter mails by embedded WebID certificates, by content or by an arbitrary number of header values. These folders can then be accessed via IMAP through any compliant client allowing for powerful server-side filtering which is consistent between clients and devices.</p>
      <p>ODS Mail provides all the tools required to build a fully featured WebMail system or E-Mail filtering proxy.</p>

Publish all bookmarks to Delicious or any writable URL, subscribe to bookmark feeds from Delicious or any URL including WebDAV.</p>
      <p>Bookmarks can be tagged, commented, or shared through ODS' powerful ACL rule system. Smart folders allow to filter bookmarks into virtual hierarchies allowing different views onto the same data.</p>
      <p>Like with all resources in ODS bookmarks are exposed as RSS, Atom, or RDF feeds which can be accessed by any client or person with the appropriate permissions. These feeds are directly available in the ODS Briefcase (the ODS WebDAV file storage system) in special virtual folders.</p>

ODS Weblog supports a variety of content publishing protocols including Blogger, Meta Weblog, or Atom. As with most other ODS content blog entries are syndicated in various formats including RSS, Atom, OPML, or XBEL.</p>
      <p>Blog posts can be automatically archived by year, month, and category. A sophisticated comment engine based on the ODS Discussion system allows to manage comment thread on each blog post. Every aspect of the blog system is protected by ODS' sophisticated ACL rule system allowing to grant access to any person or group of person.</p>
      <p>The ODS Weblog exposes search requests in any of the supported syndication formats and additionally OpenSearch and GData. Posts can be queried through free text, GData, XQuery, or XPath queries. Making use of ODS' Linked-Data exposure and Virtuoso's SPARQL endpoint any blog can be queried through SPARQL, always controlled by the powerful ACL rule system.</p>
      <p>ODS Weblog can send pings (TrackBack) to a variety of third-party services to publish newly written blog posts.</p>
      <p>Blog posts can be categorized and tagged including semantic MOAT (Meaning Of A Tag) annotations which connect tags to a semantic meaning.</p>

All they require is to authenticate themselves with their WebID which ODS can map to the individual users' ACL rules.</p>
      <p>ODS has a complex ACL rule system which supports fixed groups of people and dynamic groups. Dynamic groups are defined by conditions that the persons need to fulfill. A typical example could be to create the group of all friends by using the foaf:knows relation as condition. Other examples include the exploitation of Virtuoso's transitivity support by creating a family group. All this is possible via dynamic groups defined by arbitrarily complex SPARQL ASK queries.</p>
